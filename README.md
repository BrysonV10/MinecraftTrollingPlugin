# MinecraftTrollingPlugin
Troll your friends on your Minecraft Server
 
  
What this plugin does is that whenever the user that you specify breaks a block, it immediently replaces it with a block of bedrock. This does no damage to their tools and can really mess with them, especially if their friend is streaming live on twitch.
