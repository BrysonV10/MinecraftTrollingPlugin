# MinecraftTrollingPlugin
Troll your friends on your Minecraft Server
 
  
What this plugin does is that whenever the user that you specify breaks a block, it immediently replaces it with a block of bedrock. This does no damage to their tools and can really mess with them, especially if their friend is streaming live on twitch.
 
  
   
    
Thats right Asher, it was me lol.  
I didn't love the way that you immediently thought it was Morgan, but that can be excused with a deop.
