# MinecraftTrollingPlugin
Troll your friends on your Minecraft Server
 
  
What this plugin does is that whenever the user that you specify breaks a block, it immediently replaces it with a block of bedrock. 
This can really screw with your friends, especially if your future track coach doesn't completely understand how a minecraft server works and doesn't know that I can create minecraft mods
